# All in one easy-to-use privacy box - How do I install it?
![69,- EUR incl. VAT, transparent case](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d10ce6b1-d49a-4318-b5d7-f41664222bd2.png)

1. Purchase your own Raspberry Pi 3 set including a 16GB SD card and a 3A AC adapter (do not use a weak mobile / cell phone charger instead!) to meet our minimum hardware requirements.
2. Shop with us below! Go and help us funding our project. It will mean a lot to us and is easy for you. Our Amazon vendors are approved and tested. Start building your own affordable VPN privacy box as fast as your delivery men can run! Visit our equipment section below.
3. Download our latest customised Raspbian Jessie image below. It is not a standard Raspbian image hence should only be downloaded from our download repositories. It is made to run seamlessly on Raspberry Pi 3\.
4. Flash your Micro SD card with [Etcher][0] or follow the section "Writing an image to the SD card" on the official Raspberry Pi page [here][1].
5. Connect your Internet router with a CAT5 network cable to your Pi's network card.
6. Insert the SD Card into your Raspberry and power it on by connecting the 3A AC adapter.
7. Connect to the wireless network "securewifi". **Default Wifi Password: r2d2secure**
8. On your Laptop or Smartphone open a browser and access the website [https://10.11.12.1][2]
9. Confirm any certificate error (it is a self signed certificate and your browser may complain. Nevertheless it is still secure to proceed.)
10. Login with the default Web GUI credentials. **Username: pi Password: raspberry**
11. Change your Web GUI password under "Options". Change your Wifi password under "WiFi Setup". Make sure you remember them!
12. Create your own Cyberghost account [here][3].
13. Create your personalized Cyber Ghost VPN user and password (required user to connect your privacy box under "VPN Setup"). With Cyber Ghost Premium Plus you can run up to 5 VPN users in parallel. Each privacy box requires one user only. Simply follow our step-by-step guide how to create a single user / password below.
14. Once done fill in your Cyber Ghost account details under "VPN Setup" on the privacy box GUI. Choose your server you'd like to connect to and scroll down to the user form to fill-in your CyberGhost username and password details via copy and paste.
15. Voil√†! You are now surfing securely. Make sure you stay connected to "securewifi" at all times.
